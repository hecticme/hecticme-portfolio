### Live page: https://hecticme.pages.dev/
---
#### This is my first Portfolio, created with only basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Originally, I thought to myself that it will be easier to maintain the project if I only use basic language, and I won't have to change the syntax because it does not depend on 3rd-party library. That thought didn't live long, for various reasons...

I design the page myself so it partly reflects the aesthetics I'm looking for, hope that you like it too (*if you ever find this of course*) 🙆‍♂️.
